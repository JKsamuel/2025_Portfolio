## Challenges and Learnings

One challenge was modeling a complex sales dataset that involved multiple pipelines, product hierarchies, and regional mappings, while ensuring performance at scale. To address this, I optimized relationships and used calculated tables and measures efficiently in Power BI.
I also focused on enhancing user experience by incorporating intuitive visuals and scenario analysis tools, learning how to present dense sales data in a digestible, actionable format.

## Outcome

This dashboard is expected to become a key tool for sales performance monitoring, enhancing visibility across teams and accelerating decision-making.
