## Overview

This Power BI dashboard was built to help regional sales managers and executives monitor pipeline health and performance across U.S. territories. By combining geographic mapping, pipeline breakdowns, and detailed sales record tables, the dashboard enables deeper analysis into which regions, managers, and industries are driving revenue opportunities.

## Key Features

- Territory-Level Revenue Analysis: Displays pipeline revenue segmented by U.S. regions (e.g., South, West, Midwest, Northeast) using bar charts and maps.
- Manager Performance Tracking: Visualizes pipeline ownership and performance by sales manager.
- Geographic Heat Map: Provides a choropleth view of sales activity across states for intuitive regional comparison.
- Industry Trends Over Time: Includes a time-based area chart showing pipeline volume across top industries from November 2021 to April 2022.
- Detailed Opportunity Table: Lists each open opportunity by territory, sales stage, owner, product, and expected value for granular drill-down.

## Technologies Used

- Power BI: For data modeling, report design, and visual interactivity.
- DAX: Used to create measures for Days Until Close, Forecast Totals, and aggregated pipeline metrics.

## Challenges and Learnings

A key challenge was integrating and visualizing large volumes of sales opportunity data across multiple time periods and geographic hierarchies. This required optimizing filters, slicers, and DAX measures for performance and clarity.
Additionally, standardizing date handling (e.g., days until close, weeks open) and building meaningful visuals from dense tables taught valuable lessons in simplifying data without losing insight.

## Outcome

The dashboard enabled sales leaders to pinpoint underperforming territories, recognize top-performing managers, and track how industry demand evolved over time. It has improved transparency across teams and helped guide more strategic territory planning and forecasting.
