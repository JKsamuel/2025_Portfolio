## Fleeting thoughts

There are times when I work with fact tables that are connected to something like SCD Type 2 dimensions (_not strictly SCD Type 2, but similar in behavior_).

<div
  style={{
    width: "100%",
    overflow: "hidden",
    borderRadius: "10px",
  }}
>
  <img
    src="/images/projects/portfolio/1744759670509.jpeg"
    alt="Example image"
    style={{ width: "100%", height: "100%", objectFit: "cover" }}
  />
</div>

One mistake I made in the past when building a semantic model was simply using `SUM()` for measures — like `SUM([Ordered Qty])`.

As a result, Ordered Qty was returning something like:

[Ordered Qty] × [Number of matching dimension records] for a single order ID.

Which, of course, is incorrect.

To fix this, I use the following approach to ensure proper aggregation at the **Order ID + Order Line** level:

<CodeBlock
    radius="none"
    topRadius="l"
    codeInstances={[
      {
        code:
`// Approach 1
Ordered Qty :=
 SUMX(
      SUMMARIZE(
                [TABLE],
                [Order ID],
                [Order Line],
                "Qty", MAX([Ordered Qty])
      ),
      [Qty]
 )

// Approach 2
Ordered Qty :=
SUMX(
GROUPBY(
[TABLE],
[Order ID],
[Order Line],
"qty", MAXX(CURRENTGROUP(), [Order Line])
),
[qty]
)
\`\`\``,
language: "DAX",
label: "CodeBlock"
}
]}
/>
