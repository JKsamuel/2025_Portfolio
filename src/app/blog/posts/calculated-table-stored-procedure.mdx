Calculated Table vs. Stored Procedure in Tabular Modeling â€” Which One Should You Use?

## Content

In my previous team, It wasnâ€™t a commonly used approach in our team back then, so I took a different route by building a calculated table in DAX â€” structured as a combined Fact + Dimension table â€” and connected it to other dimensions to build the model.I didnâ€™t receive much formal feedback from the team, but from what I observed, it met user expectations and continues to run smoothly.

That got me thinking:ðŸ’­ Should I continue creating calculated tables in DAX, or would it be better to prepare the data using a SQL stored procedure or view and bring it into the model that way?

## Calculated Tables (DAX)

- Great for quick prototypes and self-contained models
- Easy to create and manage within the model
- Can be slow or memory-intensive with large datasets

## Stored Procedures (SQL)

- Better performance for large-scale or complex data
- Easier to reuse across systems
- Less flexible for quick experimentation
